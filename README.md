# Corroborate

## Usage

To use this app, just fork and clone, run `cd Corroborate`, run `bundle install` run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.

## Summary

This is a proof of concept corroboration web app that utilizes the Sinatra framework. The hope is to create a place where victims of abuse can post claims about a subject, find and get in touch with corroborators, and search subjects to learn about past claims.

 This idea stemmed from the fact that while you can google a famous person like Brock Turner or Bill Cosby and plainly see any allegations against them, nothing like that exists for non-famous abusers. A web app like this would not only serve to warn people about past abusive behaviors of certain subjects, but it could be a tool to find corroboration so that in certain instances, legal action can be taken. Giving corroborators a way to find and get in touch with each other may also have therapeutic value for certain victims who wish to be contacted. There will also be a way to post anonymously. 

While I realize there are many safeguards that will need to be put in place to prevent defamation and false reports, I am merely seeking to organize public information into an easily searchable database. Eventually, I'd like to find a way to link an app like this to public criminal records and sex offender lists to further verify testimonials and claims against a subject. This project will serve as a first step in fleshing out this idea.
